Global Economic & Demographic Trends Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global economic and demographic data (Population, GDP, Literacy, Infant Mortality, and related indicators) using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to uncover insights, highlight regional disparities, and present trends through an interactive dashboard.

📂 Datasets Used

CountriesWorld (SQL Database): GDP per capita, literacy, infant mortality, demographics.

PopulationPerCountry (Excel): Population data from 1960–2017.

GDP by Country (Excel): GDP data from 1960–2016.

MetaData (Excel): Region, income group, and country details.

🔧 Steps Performed

Data Cleaning & Transformation (handled missing values, standardized country codes).

Built relationships across datasets using Country Code.

Descriptive Statistical Analysis (mean, median, std. dev., range).

DAX Measures: Population Growth, GDP Growth, GDP per Capita, Aggregates by Region.

Interactive Visualizations: Maps, Line Charts, Bar Charts, Scatter Plots.

📊 Dashboard Features

KPI Cards: World Population, GDP, Literacy Rate, Infant Mortality.

Interactive Slicers: Year, Region, Income Group.

Trend Analysis: Population & GDP growth (1960–2017).

Comparative Analysis: Literacy vs GDP correlation, Regional disparities.

🔑 Key Insights

Developing regions → high population growth, low GDP per capita.

Literacy strongly correlates with higher GDP levels.

Infant mortality declining globally but still high in low-income regions.

✅ Recommendations

Invest in Education to drive economic growth.

Strengthen Healthcare to reduce infant mortality.

Encourage Sustainable Development for balanced growth.
